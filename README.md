# shopping-behavior


[As a junior data analyst at a fast-growing online shopping company headquartered in Bengaluru, India. "FlashFash" has recently gone public with a 90 Billion USD IPO evaluation which will allow it to establish operations in the global market.
To get an understanding of the American market, my team has been tasked with analyzing the shopping behavior of consumers.Our job entailed us analyzing the sample dataset data/raw/shopping.csv for aggregate descriptive statistics and visualizations on American consumers. We are interested in discovering the "seasonality" of shoppers, which demographics buy the most, and which market outreach strategies we can apply to maximize purchases.]




## Observations 

[The main question we wanted to ask or solve: 
What are the most popular colors by season?
What is the most popular clothing item by season?
What is the effect of promo-codes on the dollar-amount of purchases?
When do users leave a review?

In Part 1 "Exploratory Data Analysis"
We first begin data analysis by exploring our dataset. We generated visualizations like with .boxplot, .scatterplot, .kdeplot, sns.histplot, and .barh to find patterns and outliers.
Follow along with the instructions and documentation provided within the code/01explore.ipynb file. You will be focusing on the data/raw/shopping.csv file.
in Part 2 'Data Transformation' Within this step, we cleaned and transformed our dataset to help answer our primary questions. By finding null values either manipulating them or dropping he missing valiues with certain columns which allows us to create a new dataset file with the right infoprmation we need. In Part 3 "Aggregate Stats" we focused on the primary questions even more by diving deeper into our dataset and manipulating it to make mutiple datatsets in order to retrive the answers we needeed.]
